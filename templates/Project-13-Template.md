# Project 13: Purple Team Exercise — APT Campaign Simulation
**Platform:** Any.Run + MITRE ATT&CK Navigator + Atomic Red Team + Splunk/Wazuh | **Duration:** 2 weeks | **Difficulty:** Advanced

---

## Project Overview

Select a **real APT campaign** (Lazarus Group or Scattered Spider), reproduce the full attack chain in an isolated lab — from initial access through lateral movement to data exfiltration — then build **detections for EVERY step** using Sigma rules and SIEM. Document the complete kill chain with ATT&CK mapping and a detection coverage matrix proving zero detection gaps.

**This project proves you can:**
- Analyze real-world APT campaigns and reproduce their TTPs
- Execute adversary emulation across the full kill chain
- Build detection rules that cover 100% of attack stages
- Create ATT&CK Navigator coverage heatmaps
- Think strategically about detection gaps and defensive architecture
- Operate as both red and blue team — the purple team leadership mindset

**The Impact:** Achieve 100% detection coverage for a real APT campaign with <5 minute MTTD per attack stage.

---

## Learning Objectives

- Research and decompose real APT campaigns into discrete TTPs
- Execute adversary emulation using Atomic Red Team tests
- Map every attack step to MITRE ATT&CK techniques with evidence
- Build Sigma detection rules for each attack stage
- Create detection coverage matrices quantifying defensive posture
- Use ATT&CK Navigator to visualize coverage and gaps
- Develop comprehensive purple team documentation

## Step-by-Step Execution Plan

### **Week 1: Campaign Research & Attack Emulation**

#### Day 1-2: APT Campaign Decomposition

**Step 1: Research Scattered Spider TTPs**

```markdown
## Scattered Spider (UNC3944) — Campaign Analysis

- **Method:** Use compromised credentials to access servers
- **Goal:** Reach high-value targets (DC, file servers, databases)
- **Emulation:** PsExec, RDP with stolen creds

#### Phase 6: Collection & Exfiltration (T1560 + T1567)
- **Technique:** Archive data, exfil to cloud storage
- **Method:** 7zip compression, upload to Mega.nz / attacker-controlled cloud
- **Goal:** Steal sensitive data for extortion
- **Emulation:** Compress and upload test data

#### Phase 7: Impact (T1486)
- **Technique:** Ransomware deployment (BlackCat/ALPHV)
- **Method:** Deploy via GPO or PsExec to all endpoints
- **Goal:** Encrypt systems + double extortion
- **Emulation:** Simulated encryption (safe test files only)

## Interview Talking Points

### Question: "What is purple teaming and how does it differ from red/blue teaming?"

**STAR Answer:**

**Situation:**  
"Traditional red and blue team exercises operate in silos — red team attacks, writes a report, blue team reads it months later. This creates a gap where findings aren't immediately operationalized."

**Task:**  
"I conducted a purple team exercise where I played both roles simultaneously — executing each attack step and immediately building the detection for it."

**Action:**  
"I selected the Scattered Spider campaign because it's highly relevant — they compromised MGM Resorts using social engineering and identity abuse, which are the most common attack vectors in 2026.

I decomposed their campaign into 7 phases and 12 ATT&CK techniques. For each technique, I executed the attack using Atomic Red Team, observed the telemetry in my SIEM, then wrote a Sigma detection rule specifically targeting the indicators I saw.

For example, for their persistence technique of creating local accounts, I ran `net user /add`, observed Windows Event ID 4720 firing, and wrote a Sigma rule that triggers on any 4720 event from a non-administrative context. I then re-ran the attack to confirm the detection worked.

I repeated this for all 12 techniques and documented everything in a detection coverage matrix."

**Result:**  
"I achieved 100% detection coverage with an average 2.1-minute detection time. The ATT&CK Navigator heatmap gave clear visibility into our detection posture. The key insight: purple teaming is the fastest way to close detection gaps because you're building detections with the attack fresh in front of you."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Skipping research:** Understand the REAL APT TTPs before emulating
2. **Running on production:** ALWAYS use isolated lab network
3. **Not cleaning up:** Remove Atomic Red Team artifacts after each test
4. **Testing only easy techniques:** Include the hard-to-detect techniques too
5. **Ignoring false positives:** Validate each rule against normal activity baseline
6. **No coverage matrix:** Without metrics, you can't prove value to leadership

---

**Total Time Investment:** 30-40 hours over 2 weeks  
**Portfolio Artifacts:** Campaign analysis, 10+ Sigma rules, ATT&CK heatmap, coverage matrix  
**Job Market Value:** Purple team experience is the #1 differentiator for senior security roles — proves you understand both sides

---

**This project is the ultimate proof of security maturity — you attack like red, defend like blue, and report like a security leader.** 🟣⚔️🛡️
