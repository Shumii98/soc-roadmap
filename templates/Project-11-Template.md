# Project 11: Active Directory Attack & Defense Lab
**Platform:** Home Lab + BloodHound + Impacket + Splunk/Wazuh | **Duration:** 3 weeks | **Difficulty:** Advanced

---

## Project Overview

Build a **vulnerable Active Directory environment** using BadBlood or GOAD, then execute real-world AD attacks (Kerberoasting, DCSync, Pass-the-Hash, Golden Ticket) while simultaneously detecting each attack using custom Sigma rules in Splunk/Wazuh. This purple-team approach builds both offensive understanding and defensive detection engineering — the hallmark of a security leader who understands the attacker's perspective.

**This project proves you can:**
- Deploy and manage enterprise Active Directory infrastructure
- Execute advanced identity-based attacks (the #1 attack vector in 2026)
- Engineer detections for every attack stage using Sigma rules
- Think like both attacker AND defender — essential purple team mindset
- Secure the identity control plane that protects the entire organization

**The Impact:** Detect 100% of simulated AD attacks with custom rules, achieving <5 minute MTTD for identity-based threats.

---

## Learning Objectives

- Deploy vulnerable Active Directory lab environments (BadBlood/GOAD)
- Master AD attack techniques: Kerberoasting, AS-REP Roasting, DCSync, Pass-the-Hash, Golden/Silver Ticket, PrintNightmare
- Map each attack to MITRE ATT&CK techniques with evidence
- Build custom Sigma detection rules for every attack vector
- Use BloodHound to identify and remediate AD attack paths
- Analyze Windows Security Event Logs for attack indicators
- Implement AD hardening and defense-in-depth strategies

## Step-by-Step Execution Plan

### **Week 1: Lab Deployment & Reconnaissance**

#### Day 1-3: Build the Active Directory Lab

**Step 1: Deploy Domain Controller**

```powershell
# On Windows Server VM — Install AD DS
Install-WindowsFeature -Name AD-Domain-Services -IncludeManagementTools

# Promote to Domain Controller
Install-ADDSForest `
  -DomainName "soclab.local" `
  -DomainNetbiosName "SOCLAB" `
  -SafeModeAdministratorPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString "P@ssw0rd!" -AsPlainText -Force) `
  -InstallDns:$true `
  -Force:$true

# Server will reboot automatically
```

**Step 2: Inject Vulnerabilities with BadBlood**

```powershell
# Download BadBlood
git clone https://github.com/davidprowe/BadBlood.git C:\BadBlood
cd C:\BadBlood

# Run BadBlood — creates 2,500+ users, groups, OUs, ACLs, SPNs
.\Invoke-BadBlood.ps1

# This creates:
# - Users with weak passwords and SPNs (Kerberoastable)
# - Users with "Do not require Kerberos preauthentication" (AS-REP Roastable)
# - Overprivileged accounts and nested group memberships
# - Misconfigured ACLs enabling DCSync
# - Service accounts with domain admin memberships
```

**Step 3: Install Sysmon on DC and Workstation**

```powershell
# Download Sysmon
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://live.sysinternals.com/Sysmon64.exe" -OutFile "C:\Tools\Sysmon64.exe"

# Download SwiftOnSecurity Sysmon config
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config/master/sysmonconfig-export.xml" -OutFile "C:\Tools\sysmonconfig.xml"

# Install with config
C:\Tools\Sysmon64.exe -accepteula -i C:\Tools\sysmonconfig.xml
```

**Step 4: Configure Log Forwarding to SIEM**

```bash
# On Wazuh server — add Windows agent
/var/ossec/bin/manage_agents -a DC01 -n DC01

# On Splunk — install Universal Forwarder on DC01
# Configure inputs.conf to collect:
# - Security Event Log (4624, 4625, 4672, 4768, 4769, 4776)
# - Sysmon (all events)
# - PowerShell Script Block Logging (4104)
```

**Validation:** DC01 operational, 2,500+ users created, Sysmon logging, events flowing to SIEM.

---

#### Day 4-5: AD Reconnaissance with BloodHound

**Step 1: Collect AD Data with SharpHound**

```powershell
# From domain-joined workstation (WS01)
# Download SharpHound
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/SharpHound/releases/latest/download/SharpHound-v2.0.0.zip" -OutFile "C:\Tools\SharpHound.zip"
Expand-Archive C:\Tools\SharpHound.zip -DestinationPath C:\Tools\SharpHound

# Run collection
C:\Tools\SharpHound\SharpHound.exe --collectionmethods All --domain soclab.local

# Output: ZIP file with JSON data
```

**Step 2: Import into BloodHound and Analyze**

```bash
# On attack machine — start BloodHound
sudo neo4j start
bloodhound &

# Import SharpHound ZIP via BloodHound GUI
# Run built-in queries:
# - "Find Shortest Paths to Domain Admins"
# - "Find Kerberoastable Users"
# - "Find AS-REP Roastable Users"
# - "Find Users with DCSync Rights"
# - "Shortest Paths from Owned Principals"
```

**Step 3: Document Attack Paths**

```markdown
## BloodHound Attack Path Analysis

### Path 1: Kerberoast → Domain Admin
svc_sql (Kerberoastable SPN) → Password cracked → Member of "IT Admins"
→ GenericAll on "Domain Admins" group → Full domain compromise
**Hops:** 3 | **Difficulty:** Medium | **Detection:** Sigma Rule HUNT-AD-01

### Path 2: AS-REP Roast → Lateral Movement
user.jones (No preauth) → Hash cracked → Local admin on WS01
→ Dump cached creds → Domain Admin hash found
**Hops:** 4 | **Difficulty:** Medium | **Detection:** Sigma Rule HUNT-AD-02

### Path 3: DCSync Direct
helpdesk_admin → Has "Replicating Directory Changes" ACL on domain
→ DCSync to dump all hashes → Golden Ticket
**Hops:** 2 | **Difficulty:** Low | **Detection:** Sigma Rule HUNT-AD-03

## Interview Talking Points

### Question: "Tell me about your experience with Active Directory security."

**STAR Answer:**

**Situation:**  
"Active Directory remains the backbone of enterprise identity management, and identity-based attacks like Kerberoasting and DCSync are the most common paths to full domain compromise. I wanted to build deep expertise in both attacking and defending AD."

**Task:**  
"I built a full AD lab environment with realistic vulnerabilities, then executed every major AD attack technique while simultaneously building detections for each one — a true purple team approach."

**Action:**  
"I deployed a Windows Server 2019 domain controller and used BadBlood to create 2,500+ users with realistic misconfigurations — accounts with SPNs, weak passwords, overprivileged ACLs.

Using BloodHound, I mapped all attack paths to Domain Admin and identified 12 critical escalation routes. Then I systematically executed each attack: Kerberoasting with Impacket to crack service account tickets, DCSync to dump all domain hashes, Pass-the-Hash for lateral movement, and Golden Ticket for persistent domain access.

For each attack, I built a corresponding Sigma detection rule targeting the specific Windows Event IDs — 4769 with RC4 encryption for Kerberoasting, 4662 for DCSync replication requests from non-DCs, LogonType 9 for Pass-the-Hash. Each rule was tested against the actual attack traffic and tuned to minimize false positives."

**Result:**  
"I achieved 100% detection coverage for all critical AD attacks with under 5-minute detection time. More importantly, I used BloodHound findings to implement hardening — removing unnecessary SPNs, deploying gMSA for service accounts, enabling Credential Guard, and implementing a tiered administration model. This reduced attack paths to Domain Admin from 12 to zero."

---

### Question: "How would you protect an organization's Active Directory?"

**Strong Answer:**  
"I think about AD defense in layers, prioritized by attack frequency:

**1. Identity Hygiene (prevents 60% of attacks):**
- Remove all unnecessary SPNs — eliminate Kerberoasting surface
- Deploy LAPS for unique local admin passwords — prevent lateral movement
- Enforce AES-only Kerberos — make ticket cracking computationally infeasible
- Audit 'Replicating Directory Changes' ACLs — only DCs should have this

**2. Detection (catches what prevention misses):**
- Monitor Event ID 4769 for RC4 ticket requests (Kerberoasting)
- Alert on 4662 replication requests from non-DC sources (DCSync)
- Track LogonType 9 with seclogo (Pass-the-Hash)
- Correlate TGS without preceding TGT (Golden Ticket)

**3. Architecture (limits blast radius):**
- Tiered administration: Tier 0 (DCs), Tier 1 (servers), Tier 2 (workstations)
- Domain admin accounts only log into DCs — enforced via GPO
- Credential Guard on all endpoints — prevents hash extraction
- Protected Users security group for all privileged accounts

**4. Continuous Validation:**
- Quarterly BloodHound scans to find new attack paths
- Purple team exercises simulating each attack type
- Automated AD health scoring and drift detection

This layered approach ensures that even if one control fails, multiple others catch the attack."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Running attacks on production:** ALWAYS use isolated lab — never attack real AD
2. **Skipping BloodHound:** Without attack path visibility, you're defending blind
3. **Writing too-broad detections:** EventID 4769 alone = massive false positives → filter encryption type
4. **Ignoring Sysmon:** Windows Security logs alone miss many attack indicators
5. **Not rotating krbtgt:** After Golden Ticket testing, rotate TWICE (immediate + 12hr)
6. **Forgetting cleanup:** Remove all attack tools and backdoors from lab after testing

---

## Next Steps

1. **Move to Project 12:** Cloud Security Investigation (AWS/Azure)
2. **Expand:** Add AS-REP Roasting, PrintNightmare, Zerologon attacks
3. **Certify:** Consider GIAC GCDA (Defending Advanced Threats) or CRTO
4. **Contribute:** Share Sigma rules on SigmaHQ GitHub repository
5. **Blog:** Write "Detecting Kerberoasting: A Practical Guide"

---

**Total Time Investment:** 40-50 hours over 3 weeks  
**Portfolio Artifacts:** Lab architecture, BloodHound paths, 6 Sigma rules, detection matrix, hardening guide  
**Job Market Value:** AD security expertise is mandatory for any senior security role — this project proves offensive + defensive mastery
